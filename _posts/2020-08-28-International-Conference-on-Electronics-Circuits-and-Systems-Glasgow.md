YP collaborated with CAS to jointly organise a one-day YP track during the 27th edition of the 27th IEEE International Conference on Electronics Circuits and Systems (ICECS) which is the flagship conference for Region 8 IEEE Circuits and Systems. The event is targeted towards postgraduate and young professional researchers with a series of opening talks, followed by technical papers on topics broadly relating to this yearâ€™s theme, poster competition and a demo session. Accepted papers will be published in IEEE Xplore. Event currently planned to be face to face but a full virtual event or hybrid model is being considered due to the current pandemic situation.
