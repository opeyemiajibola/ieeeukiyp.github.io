_The future of STEM in a shifting landscape_

Wednesday, 10<sup>th</sup> November 2021

The IEEE Young Professionals, UK & Ireland Section, is hosting a virtual postgraduate STEM research symposium

{% include gallery id="sponsors" layout="half" %}

This **FREE ONE DAY** symposium is an opportunity for early career STEM researchers, especially PGRs (PhD and MPhil), to present their research, receive feedback, and explore the possibilities of turning research to enterprise.

_The first symposium held at the University of Chester in 2018_

The symposium is open to professionals and students across the country and beyond and we are now accepting submissions of abstracts for research work for oral and poster presentations. No full paper submission is required. **The deadline for abstract submission has been extended to 18th October 2021 and free registration is open until the same date. There is a chance to win research quality and best presentation awards (4 awards in all).**

# SUBMIT YOUR ABSTRACT

Non presenting participants are also invited to register. **Registration is required in order to receive joining instructions.**

# Symposium Features

The event focuses on research presentations, posters, keynote, panel discussion, workshop, awards, and a networking event with Industry participation. See the event [flyer](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Tj8MhwLSM9N6B9Bsem_FQy9wyoFwqIJg/view)

# Keynote and workshop:

Learn from notable experts as they deliver [keynote](https://ieeeukiyp.org/3rd_stem/keynotes/) talks on various STEM topics.

# Presentations

Participants are invited to [submit](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/14a5HUKipHQ8JKVHjiPbfj4F5vDLkF4p--VzIGqOMnRU/viewform) abstracts of their research for oral/poster presentation at the symposium. The submissions will be classified and presented through different tracks. This is not a peer reviewed conference and full paper submission is not required -- the idea here is to give participants the opportunity to discuss their research before an unfamiliar audience and get feedback which will help them improve their work for subsequent presentations. A poster session will allow participants to interact with different researchers on their displayed research topics.
