_Exploring the multidisciplinary landscape of technology_

The IEEE Young Professionals, UK & Ireland Section, is hosting a hybrid postgraduate STEM research symposium.

{% include gallery id="sponsors" layout="half" %}

This **FREE ONE DAY** symposium is an opportunity for early career STEM researchers, especially PGRs (PhD and MPhil), to present their research, receive feedback, and explore the possibilities of turning research to enterprise.

_The first symposium held at the University of Chester in 2018_

The symposium is open to professionals and students across the country and beyond and we are now accepting submissions of 1-page abstracts of research work for oral presentations. No full paper submission is required. **The deadline for abstract submission has been extended to 18th October 2023 and free registration is open until the same date. There is a chance to win research quality and best presentation awards (4 awards in all).**

# Symposium Features

The event focuses on research presentations, posters, keynote, panel discussion, workshop, awards, and a networking event with Industry participation. See the event [flyer](assets/images/4th_stem/flyerland.jpeg)

# Keynote and workshop:

Learn from notable experts as they deliver [keynote](https://ieeeukiyp.org/) talks on various STEM topics. The symposium will also offers workshops on a range of topics.

# Presentations

Participants are invited to [submit](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/14a5HUKipHQ8JKVHjiPbfj4F5vDLkF4p--VzIGqOMnRU/viewform) abstracts of their research for oral/poster presentation at the symposium. The submissions will be classified and presented through different tracks. This is not a peer reviewed conference and full paper submission is not required -- the idea here is to give participants the opportunity to discuss their research before an unfamiliar audience and get feedback which will help them improve their work for subsequent presentations. A poster session will allow participants to interact with different researchers on their displayed research topics.
