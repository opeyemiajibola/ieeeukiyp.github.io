                                <p><h1>Event summary of IEEE Young Entrepreneurs Open Day, London 2016</h1> </p><br>
								<p>More than 90 students and young professionals gathered to take part in the much-anticipated IEEE Young Entrepreneurs Day on Saturday 11th June, at the University of Greenwich, London. The event is the first in a series planned by the UK and Ireland Section aimed towards people looking for inspiration, resources and guidance to help develop themselves professionally or start and grow their own business. The day attracted a diverse audience of delegates from many backgrounds, including many undergraduate and postgraduate research students from universities across the UK and Europe. The event was run as an Open Day to allow participation from the young non-associates and members of the public and as a measure of IEEE’s corporate social responsibility in the UK and Ireland. </p>
								<p> Following opening announcements by the IEEE section committee, the delegates had the opportunity to take part in interactive workshops provided by Google Digital Garage, IBM, Entrepreneur First, and a full schedule of speakers offering advice and experience in entrepreneurship ranging from the current Vice President of the IMechE to professional networking coaches. A social lunch and IEEE drop-in sessions allowed for the delegates to find out more about the IEEE and its numerous affinity groups and chapters, and the opportunity to take advantage of current registration offers. This included the Student Activities Committee, the Young Professionals subcommittee, the Women in Engineering affinity group and the Power and Energy Society chapter amongst others. Representatives from AWE, the main event sponsor, were on-hand to explain entrepreneurial opportunities within their UK-based organisation. The event continued late into the afternoon with personal networking and social activities, and interviews with speakers and delegates affirmed the overwhelmingly positive feel of the day.</p>
								<p> On behalf of the IEEE UK and Ireland section we would like to give our sincere thanks to all speakers, exhibitors, sponsors, committee members and above all attendees who made this event such a success. 
The Section is already planning a major industrial and technological showcase event in collaboration with the IEEE MGA under the banner of SmartTech that will take place during 21-22 October in Birmingham. 
The next IEEE Young Entrepreneurs Day is now being planned to take place in Ireland later in 2016, so check the UK and Ireland Section website and social media for more details!

                                <p>Greenwich is an early-established district of London, which is notable for its maritime history and for giving its name to the Greenwich Meridian (0° longitude) and Greenwich Mean Time. The town became the site of a royal palace, the Palace of Placentia from the 15th century, and was the birthplace of many Tudors, including Henry VIII and Elizabeth I.</p>
